# homework-4

This is the 4th homework of the UW Coding Bootcamp, which requires me to create a quiz show using JavaScript. It must ask questions about our current class and cycle through every question once answered until the timer reaches zero or all questions have been answered. Then we need to use local storage to save high scores and name.

I had a lot of trouble doing this assignment, therefore it is mostly incomplete aside from establishing a timer and the buttons needed to display the potential answers.
